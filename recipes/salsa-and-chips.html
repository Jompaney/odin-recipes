        </ul>
        <h4>Chips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A package of corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Salt - 3 pinches</li>
            <li>Olive oil - 1 tablespoon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Salsa</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop up all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Add ingredients into a food processor</li>
            <li>Blend until desired consistency</li>
            <li>Oreder up!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Chips</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the tortilla quarters with the oil (1 tablespoon) and kosher salt (1/2 teaspoon). Be gentle so the tortillas don't break- I recommend using your hands for this, to make sure both sides of each chip are coated well in the oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Arrange the tortillas on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. It's OK if they touch or overlap a little bit, but try not to overlap them too much.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes in the top half of your oven, or until they're golden brown. Rotate the baking sheet once halfway through cooking to ensure even browning.</li>
            <li>Order up!</li>
        </ol>
